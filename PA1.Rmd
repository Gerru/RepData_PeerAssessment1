## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r Loaddata} 
if (!file.exists("activity.csv")) unzip("activity.zip")
data <- read.csv("activity.csv")

# Take a look at the data
head(data)
tail(data)
summary(data)

# Turn dates into Date and ad Weekday column
data$date <- as.Date(data$date)
data$weekday <- format(data$date, format = "%A")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r totalmean} 
# 1. Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
daysteps <- aggregate(data$steps, by = list(data$date), FUN = sum)
colnames(daysteps) <- c("Date", "Steps")
```

```{r daystepsplot}
# 2. Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
library(ggplot2)
m <- ggplot(daysteps, aes(x = Steps))
m + geom_histogram(fill = "red", col = "black") + 
    theme_bw() +
    labs(title = "Histogram for mean total number of steps taken per day") +
    labs(x = "Steps per day", y = "Count")
```

```{r meanmedian}
# 3. Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
meansteps <- mean(daysteps$Steps, na.rm = TRUE)
meansteps
mediansteps <- median(daysteps$Steps, na.rm = TRUE)
mediansteps
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r dailypattern}
# 1. Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
intervalsteps <- aggregate(data$steps, by = list(data$interval), FUN = mean, na.rm=TRUE)
colnames(intervalsteps) <- c("Interval", "Steps")
plot(intervalsteps, type = "l")
```

## Imputing missing values
```{r NAs}
natest1 <- aggregate(data$steps, by = list(data$interval, data$Weekday), FUN = mean, na.rm=TRUE)
natest1b <- aggregate(natest1$Steps, by = list(natest1$Weekday), FUN = sum)
natest2 <- aggregate(data$steps, by = list(data$interval, data$weekday), FUN = mean, na.rm=TRUE)
colnames(natest1) <- c("Interval", "Weekday", "Steps")
colnames(natest2) <- c("Interval", "Weekday", "Steps")
library(ggplot2)
m <- ggplot(natest1, aes(x = Weekday))
m + geom_bar(fill = "red", col = "black") + 
    theme_bw() +
    labs(title = "Mean total number of steps per Interval per Day of the Week") +
    labs(x = "Steps per week day", y = "Count")

g <- ggplot(natest1, aes(Interval, Steps, color=factor(Weekday)))
g + geom_line()
```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
